ServerButton
============

This is a simple firefox extension to run an external command depending
on the webpage loaded in the current tab. The intended purpose is to
login to the webserver, which can be really useful when you need quick
access to many different servers.

To get started, check the command configuration and add the toolbar
button to a toolbar of your choice.

Install from mozilla:
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/serverbutton/>
