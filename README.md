serverbutton
============

This is a simple firefox plugin to launch a command depending on the
domain loaded in the current tab.  It's intended purpose is to login to
the webserver. That can be really useful when you need quick access to
many different servers.

Right now, it's pretty hardwired to my setup, but I'm planning to fix
that after which I'll release it at mozilla.

TODO:
-----

-	Replace bashscript with javascript
-	Preference dialog, where you can configure executables and types.
-	Makefile to create installation file
